<title>In perfect harmony
In a world so far away
At the end of a closing day
A little child was born and raised
Deep in the forest on a hidden place
Mother never saw his face
Ancient spirits of the forest
Made him king of elves and trees
He was the only human being
Who lived in harmony
In perfect harmony
The woods protected, fulfilled his needs
Fruit by birds, honey by bees
He found shelter under trees
He grew up in their company
They became his family
A thousand seasons
They passed him by
So many times, have said goodbye
And when the spirits called out his name
To join forever, forever to stay
A forest spirit he became

<title>Grace
Cold are the bones of thy soldiers
Longing for home, their little paradise
I don't feel redemption on their side
Fallen from grace, help me rise again
Fallen from grace, help me through
Fallen from grace, help me through
Fallen from grace
Feel these hands, the pressure, the cold, tremble
Do you hear these words
Do you feel the wounds
I'll never help you through
Cold are thy souls
I feel resentment,
they feel betrayed
They hate the cold
I don't feel redemption on their side
Fallen from grace, help me rise again
Fallen from grace, help me through
